    "This assignment is due on Canvas by **MIDNIGHT on Monday November 23**. Your solutions to theoretical questions should be done in Markdown directly below the associated question.  Your solutions to computational questions should include any specified Python code and results as well as written commentary on your conclusions.  Remember that you are encouraged to discuss the problems with your classmates, but **you must write all code and solutions on your own**.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Any relevant data sets should be available under the **Data** module on Canvas, as well as in the zipped folder in which you obtained this assignment. \n",
    "- Do **NOT** load or use any Python packages that are not available in Anaconda 3.6. \n",
    "- Because you can technically evaluate notebook cells in a non-linear order, it's a good idea to do Kernel $\\rightarrow$ Restart & Run All as a check before submitting your solutions.  That way if we need to run your code you will know that it will work as expected. \n",
    "- It is **bad form** to make your reader interpret numerical output from your code.  If a question asks you to compute some value from the data you should show your code output **AND** write a summary of the results in Markdown directly below your code. \n",
    "- You **MUST** leave all of your notebook cells **evaluated** so the graders do not need to re-evaluate them. For 100+ students, this extra time adds up, and makes the graders' lives unnecessarily more difficult.\n",
    "- This probably goes without saying, but... For any question that asks you to calculate something, you **must show all work and justify your answers to receive credit**. Sparse or nonexistent work will receive sparse or nonexistent credit. \n",
    "- Submit only this Jupyter notebook to Canvas.  Do not compress it using tar, rar, zip, etc. \n",

    "One common way that p-values are being misused is their interperetation. Because of the way that it's worded, it can lead people to falsely believe that the p-value equates to the probability that the null-hypothesis is true. Additionally, this article claims that the interpretations of the p-value are overtrusted, and that the p-value alone doesn't provide enough evidence to make important business decisions. This article claims that using the gold standard of using a p-value of .05 doesn't adequately \"weed out\" false claims, and that most of the claims made are purely suggestive and not conclusive. It further claims that by lowering the p-value to .005 it will remove 1/3 of the purely \"suggestive\" hypotheses and make a move towards more \"durable\" solutions. I agree with what this article is saying. Having a p-value of .005 will lead to more accurate solutions. I think that having a p-value of .05 was fine when we didn't have access to the data we do now, and sampling was tougher. But now, when we have data so readily available and in a much higher volume than before, lowering the threshold makes sense."

    "In general, a 99% confidence interval is wider. Imagine you are guessing the age of someone who walks past you in the park, and a younger looking person walks by. You are pretty sure that they are in their late teens. You could guess a single number, and possibly be wrong. Or you could guess the age plus or minus 5 years for good measure. Most likely you are feeling more confident that the person lies within the age range than simply guessing one number. If you want to be even more confident in your answer, you could tack on 5 years to each end. Confidence intervals are similar to this - but instead of guessing someone's age, you're finding out the range in which a test statistic, like the true mean, lies. You're 95% confident that the true mean of a dataset lies within the range [5,7], but to be even more \"confident\" in that answer you say that the true mean lies in the range [3,9]. Thus a higher confidence level has a wider confidence interval."
