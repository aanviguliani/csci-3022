If you worked with a partner, you and your partner should have similar / identical work on the problems below, but your name (as the submitting student) and your partner's name should be accurately represented in the fields above.*\n",

    "This practicum is due on Canvas by **10:00 PM on Saturday, December 12** (the end of your Finals Period). Your solutions to theoretical questions should be done in Markdown/MathJax directly below the associated question.  Your solutions to computational questions should include any specified Python code and results as well as written commentary on your conclusions. \n",

You may also search online for answers to general knowledge questions like the form of a probability distribution function or how to perform a particular operation in Python/Pandas. \n",
    "3. This is meant to be like a coding portion of your midterm exam. So, the instructional team will be much less helpful than we typically are with homework. For example, we will not check answers, help debug your code, and so on. (There is a limited exception in Problem 2B)\n",
    "4. If something is left open-ended, it is because we want to see how you approach the kinds of problems you will encounter in the wild, where it will not always be clear what sort of tests/methods should be applied. Feel free to ask clarifying questions in office hours or on a private Piazza post.\n",
    "5. You may **NOT** post to public message boards or other online resources asking for help.\n",
    "6. You may **NOT** copy-paste solutions *from anywhere*.\n",

    "8. In short, **your work must be your own**. It really is that simple.\n",

    "- If you have a question for us, post it as a **PRIVATE** message on Piazza.  If we decide that the question is appropriate for the entire class, then we will add it to a Practicum clarifications thread. \n",
    "- Do **NOT** load or use any Python packages that are not available in Anaconda 3.6. \n",
    "- Some problems with code may be autograded.  If we provide a function API **do not** change it.  If we do not provide a function API then you're free to structure your code however you like. \n",
    "- Submit only this Jupyter notebook to Canvas.  Do not compress it using tar, rar, zip, etc. \n",

    "It is January of 1963, and President Kennedy has hired you as the Chief Statistician for the White House!  Your first task is to analyze and report state expenditures across the country$^1$.  You feel ready for the challenge, since you studied so hard in your statistical methods class.  On day one, JFK hands you an important data set that contains information on the 48 states in the contiguous U.S. describing per capita state and local public expenditures associated with state demographic and economic characteristics in 1960$^2$ . The data set is found in the file `stateExpenditures.txt`.\n",

    "* The economic ability index\n",
    "* The percentage of the population living in a metropolitan area\n",
    "* The percentage change in the population between 1950 and 1960\n",
    "* The percentage of the population aged 5-19 years\n",
    "* The percentage of the population over 65 years old\n",
    "* Whether the state is located in the western part of the United States or not\n",
    "\n",
    "The variables available in the data set are labeled as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* EX: \t\tPer capita state and local public expenditures (USD)\n",
    "* ECAB: \tEconomic ability index, in which income, retail sales, and the value of output (manufactures, mineral, and agricultural) per capita are equally weighted\n",
    "* MET: \t\tPercentage of population living in standard metropolitan areas\n",
    "* GROW: \tPercent change in population, 1950-1960\n",
    "* YOUNG: \tPercent of population aged 5-19 years\n",
    "* OLD: \t\tPercent of population over 65 years of age\n",
    "* WEST: \tWestern state (1) or not (0)\n",

    "Keep in mind that the president does not know how to interpret linear model output, and he wants answers in terms of things that are easily read and understood.

Does the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variables appear to be linear?  Do there appear to be independent variables that are collinear?

    "Now that you have shown yourself to be an expert in understanding and managing forest fire risk, a non-profit trying to protect the amazon rain forest has recruited you to join their data science corps. For your first task, they've given you a dataset (`amazon.csv`) with the number of reported forest fires in each state in the Amazon region of Brazil during each month between 1998 and 2017. The Brazilian government has 500 extra wildland firefighters and they have asked your non-profit to determine which state or states they should allocate these firefighters to during each month of the year. To do this, they want you to calculate an 80% confidence interval for the mean and median number of fires that occur during each month for each state, and use those statistics to determine where the firefighters should be assigned."

    "Read the csv located in `amazon.csv` into a pandas data frame. Brazil and many other countries use the period (.) symbol as a thousands separator and a comma (,) as the decimal separator. Ex. One Thousand And $\\frac{75}{100}$ would be represented as $1.000,75$ instead of the familiar english notation $1,000.75$. When you read it in, you'll need to use a period(.) as the thousands separator and a comma(,) as the decimal separator. Because the comma is already in use as the decimal separator, this file uses a different character to separate columns in the data. Open up the file in a text editor and figure out what character was used. Then find the correct arguments to `pd.read_csv` to read in this file properly. Look up the docs if you're unsure what the arguments you'll need are. Print out the `.info` summary of the dataframe after you've read it in."

    "1. Drop the 'date' column. The only information this column holds is the year, which we already have in another column. Use the `.info` summary provided to check your work.\n",
    "2. Drop any rows with null values in any of the remaining columns. Use the provided code to print the number of rows remaining after this step.\n",

    "4. Convert the Portugese month names to English month names. If you'd like to use them, we've included the 'month_name' and the 'different_encoding' modules of the python calendar library. There are many ways to accomplish this task, and these modules are not required, but may make things easier. As part of this step, you should make sure that the Portugese month with the encoding problem is translated to the correct english month. Use the `.unique` method provided for you to check your work. \n",
    "5. Check the number column for any values that seem impossible. If you find any values you think are impossible, drop them. As a guidline, we would never expect a single state to have more than 50,000 reported forest fires in a single month. Also keep in mind that we are tracking forest fires here. Do negative or fractional forest fires really make sense? You should check for any obivously impossible conditions that you think might occur, and drop rows accordingly. Use the provided code to print the number of rows remaining after this step.\n",
    "6. Since you're new on the job, some of your co-workers may have played a prank on you... Print out all the unique values of the 'year' column and drop any rows with values that don't make sense. Use the provided code to print the number of rows remaining after this step.\n",
    "7. For every state in the data, print the number of rows the state has associated with it. A number of states have far more observations than the others. Each state should have roughly 240 observations (20 years multiplied by 12 months/year minus any bad data). Drop all the observations for any states that have more than 240 rows associated with them.\n",
    "    2. For two points of extra credit, figure out why these states have way more rows associated with them than they should. If you choose to do the extra credit, put your answer in the markdown cell below. \n",
    "8. To give you an idea of whether your answer is correct, we've provided a unit test below the last cell. It should pass. If it doesn't, go back and figure out which step has gone awry.\n",

This means you may consult google, stack overflow, the python/pandas documentation, some random book on pandas you might have, etc...
